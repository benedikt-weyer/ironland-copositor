      Settings for ironland-copositor, written to
      `/etc/ironland-copositor/config.toml` and read by the compositor at
      startup (a restart is needed to pick up changes). See the
      compositor's `src/config.rs` for the full schema: keyboard layout
      under `keyboard` (passed straight through to xkbcommon), the
      terminal launched by the `run_terminal` shortcut under `terminal`, the
      browser/file manager launched by `open_browser`/`open_file_manager`
      under `browser`/`file_manager`,
      `top_bar` (whether windows may get a compositor-drawn header/title
      bar for server-side decoration; off by default, so a client's request
      for one is overridden back to client-side), key bindings under
      `shortcuts` —
      only the actions you set there override the built-in defaults, so a
      partial table is fine — and
      per-monitor settings under `outputs.<connector-name>` (e.g.
      `outputs."eDP-1"`, `outputs."HDMI-A-1"`): `primary` marks the main
      monitor, `refresh_rate` selects its refresh rate in millihertz,
      `mirror_of` duplicates another output's position onto this one, and
      `position` places this output relative to another
      (`right_of`/`left_of`/`above`/`below`, each an output name) or at an
      absolute `{ x, y }`. An output not listed here is auto-placed to the
      right of the others, matching the compositor's previous behavior.
      Gaussian background blur for translucent application windows is under
      `blur`, with `enabled` (default false) and `radius` (default 12). The
      mouse cursor theme is under `cursor`: `theme` (an installed Xcursor
      theme name) and `size` (in pixels); leaving either unset falls back to
      the `XCURSOR_THEME`/`XCURSOR_SIZE` environment variables, or the
      compositor's own built-in cursor if those aren't set either. And
      virtual desktops under `workspaces`: `mode` is `"per_monitor"`
      (default, each output has its own set) or `"combined"` (every output
      switches together); `count` is the starting number of workspaces
      (default 4); `dynamic` (default false), if true, grows the count on
      demand and prunes empty trailing workspaces automatically instead of
      keeping it fixed at `count`; `overlay` (default true) shows a row of
      dots on screen briefly whenever the active workspace changes. Switch
      workspaces with Super+Left/Right and move the focused window to an
      adjacent one with Super+Alt+Left/Right (both rebindable in
      `shortcuts` as `workspace_left`/`workspace_right` and
      `move_workspace_left`/`move_workspace_right`). Pointer/keyboard-focus
      interaction is under `focus`, both off by default (click-to-focus,
      unchanged from before either existed): `follows_mouse`, if true,
      focuses whatever window the pointer is over without needing a click
      (hovering empty space leaves the current focus alone); and
      `mouse_follows_focus`, if true, warps the pointer to the center of a
      window whenever it's focused by something other than the pointer
      itself (switching workspaces, cycling windows, a newly opened window,
      activating a window from the dock).
